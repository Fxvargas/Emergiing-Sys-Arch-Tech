# Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

The PWN_LED project was to gain an understanding on how PWM works. We created a program to run with a specific frequency and brought the output to two LEDs on the board. The LEDS would flash slowly initially then faster, then slow again. It was a basic program just to visualize the output in action using the LEDs. The GPIO_Interrupt project was to flash morse code on one of the LEDs. The PWM LED program is pretty basic and don't really have much to improve on but the GPIO Interrupt needs improvement. The code is there but it is just a matter of getting the code to function with the board properly. This will require going through the configuration file for the program to make sure that the correct GPIO buttons and LEDs are active and program accordingly in the code. Some resources that I used in these projects are the handbook that TI has on their site for this specific board and some of the sample code provided in our zyBooks material. To make the code readable, I make sure I use white space to split up some of the code tso that there aren't too many lines crunched together. I also make use of in-line comments as needed.
